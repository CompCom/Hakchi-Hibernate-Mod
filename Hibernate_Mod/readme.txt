    ** Hakchi Hibernate mod for SNES MINI **
 Made by Swingflip and made possible by CompCom

 To open the power menu, Hold L + R + UP on the controller at any point during play. This can be within canoe, retroarch or clover.
 
 Standby will power the whole console to a low power mode and when woken up it will reboot the console. 
 
 Hibernate will do a "soft" power down but when woken up it will resume where you left off. (But it doesn't save as much energy of course)
 
 When in hibernate or standby mode....
 
 Use L + R + UP to wake up the console...
 Use L + R + DOWN to shut down the console from hibernation/standby.
 
 If you are in hibernation you can also flick the power switch to shutdown. This feature is disabled in standby otherwise you can get in a boot loop!
 
 Enjoy.
