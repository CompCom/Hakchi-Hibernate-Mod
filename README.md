# Hakchi-Hibernate-Mod
#### Remote Hibernate and Power mod for the SNES mini
#### Made by Swingflip, made possible by CompCom
 
 
To open the power menu, Hold L + R + UP on the controller at any point during play. This can be within canoe, retroarch or clover.

Standby will power the whole console to a low power mode and when woken up it will reboot the console. 

Hibernate will do a "soft" power down but when woken up it will resume where you left off. (But it doesn't save as much energy of course)

When in hibernate or standby mode....

Use L + R + UP to wake up the console...
Use L + R + DOWN to shut down the console from hibernation/standby.

If you are in hibernation you can also flick the power switch to shutdown. This feature is disabled in standby otherwise you can get in a boot loop!

Enjoy. 

p.s. shout outs to the usual suspects, dantheman, dna64 and all of my other home slices. But BIG shout out to bslenul who did the art work for the power menu. (There will be more coming in the deluxe build!)
